# Kakara Engine [![Maven Version](https://mvnhelper.potatocorp.dev/kakara/org.kakara/engine/badge.png)](https://mvnhelper.potatocorp.dev/kakara/org.kakara/engine)
The Kakara Engine is a 3D hybrid voxel engine made using OpenGL and Java. The engine is mainly developed for use in the [Kakara](https://github.com/kakaragame/Kakara) video game; however, the engine can be used to make any game. The Kakara Engine is considered a low-ish level engine that allows for the use of OpenGL calls and custom shaders. It is possible that the Kakara Engine could use Vulkan in the future; however, that feature is far in the future.
