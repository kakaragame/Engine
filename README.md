# Kakara Engine [![kakara Repository](https://repo.kingtux.me/badge/maven/kakara/org/kakara/engine/badge)](https://repo.kingtux.me/project/maven/kakara/org.kakara:engine)

The Kakara Engine is a 3D hybrid voxel engine made using OpenGL and Java. The engine is mainly developed for use in
the [Kakara](https://github.com/kakaragame/Kakara) video game; however, the engine can be used to make any game. The
Kakara Engine is considered a low-ish level engine that allows for the use of OpenGL calls and custom shaders. It is
possible that the Kakara Engine could use Vulkan in the future; however, that feature is far in the future.
